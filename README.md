# Player-Tracker

## Overview:
This project aims to track football players in a live match video using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack object detection models. It provides a system that can be used by coaches and analysts to analyze the game and improve their team's performance.

## Requirements:

Python 3.7 or later
NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
PyTorch
OpenCV
YOLOv8 and ByteTrack pre-trained models

## Installation:

Install Python 3.7 or later.
Install PyTorch and OpenCV libraries.
Install CUDA support for your NVIDIA GPU.
Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 and ByteTrack models from their respective websites and extract the files.
Clone or download the project repository.


## Output:
The program outputs the following files in the specified output folder:
tracked_video.mp4: A video file with the tracking results overlaid on the original video.
